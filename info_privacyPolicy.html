                    <p>How do you get my consent?</p>
                    <p>
                        When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, 
                        arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that

                    <p>
                        Our store is hosted on Shopify Inc. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our 
                        products and services to you. Your data is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases and the general 
                        Shopify application. They store your data on a secure server behind a firewall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify stores your credit card data. It is 
                        encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is 
                        stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase 
                        transaction information is deleted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards 
                        Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service 
                        providers.
                    </p>

                <h4>SECTION 5. <b>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</b></h4>
                <div class="toggleBlock">
                    <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent 
                        necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction 
                        processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your 
                        purchase-related transactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which 
                        your personal information will be handled by these providers.
                    </p>
                    <p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located a different 
                        jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-
                        party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that 
                        service provider or its facilities are located.
                    </p>
                    <p>As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in 
                        the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure 
                        under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in

                        under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer 
                        governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.
