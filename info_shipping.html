            <h3>WHAT IS A PRE ORDER?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Pre Order simply means that the item is not yet available for shipment in our warehouse. Items purchased on pre-
                    order may take between 1-4 weeks to be delivered. By placing a pre order item/s, your entire order will be shipped 
                    when ALL products become available. (If you urgently need a product that is in stock before the pre order item is 
                    available, please place two seperate orders). Email us at sales@pabloandco.net if you would like to arrange two 
                    shipments. Please note: Delivery dates included in the description of items are approximate and subject to change. 
                    The shipping window stated reflects when the item will be shipped out - you need to allow a few days for it to arrive 
                    depending on your selected shipping method & where you are located.

                    <p>
                        Your order will be delivered through Australia Post eParcel in most cases (please see below for International shipping
                        information). The delivery time to your destination will vary according to your postcode. Full details can be found at 
                        <a href="http://www.auspost.com.au/" target="_blank">www.auspost.com.au</a>. Please allow extra time for post deliveries at peak times eg. Christmas and Easter. Pablo & Co. 
                        does not accept any responsibility for shipping times, and we cannot refund items that arrive later than required, 
                        although you may return them at your cost for a credit (exclusions may apply). A signature is required for delivery. 
                        If no-one is available to sign for your parcel, the courier should leave a card advising you of your pick-up options. As 
                        this may not always happen, we advise you to keep track of your delivery through the courier tracking number that 
                        can be found online in your Pablo & Co. account & via your email confirmation. If for any reason you do not arrange 
                        to pick the parcel up promptly from the postal outlet, the parcel will be returned to us. Should this happen, you will 
                        be required to pay a fee for re-delivery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please make sure all postal information is correct and up to date, as we take no responsibility for incorrect 
                        information or sending your item to the incorrect address. Please advise us asap PRIOR to sending your item if your 
                        address is incorrect and provide us with the correct information. Once your item is shipped unfortunately there is 
                        nothing further we can do. Great care is taken to ensure that your item arrives in perfect condition, free from defect. 
                        All our items are carefully packed and posted in secure packaging for maximum protection however please be 
                        advised that we do NOT take any personal responsibility for the courier service, with the slim chance the item 
                        becomes lost or damaged in transit.

                        required to deliver your order, they will not be able to deliver to a P O Box address, therefore we will need a street
